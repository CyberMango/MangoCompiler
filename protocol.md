ultimate demands:
    - compile multiple files.
        - with their original directories structure.
    - run code and send:
        - output.
        - return value.
        - listed errors/warnnings.
        - created files.
    - send files in parts (not whole files at once).
    - get whole input at once.
    - get input interactively (input requests when needed).
    - caching:
        - only send changed files.
        - only send diffs? FFF(Far Future Feature).
    - Have a generic makefile.
    - Allow receiving a different makefile.
    - Allow receiving compiler commands.
    - Support multiple languages!
    - Client end of connection/session request.
    - Server end of connection/session request.
    - Allow parallel actions from a single connection.
    - Have flags that allow adding more features (like the ones in the ultimate demands).
